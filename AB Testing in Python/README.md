### About the Project
In this project, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the AB-test results to determine the effect of moving the first gate from `level 30` to `level 40` on player retention. By examining the player retention rates between the two groups, we aim to draw valuable insights to help optimize the game's design and enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, we will explore the dataset, perform statistical tests, and visualize the results to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the gate relocation. Our analysis will provide valuable insights that can aid game developers and designers in making informed decisions to improve player engagement and retention
